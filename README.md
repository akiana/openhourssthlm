==============

A Digital Data Strategist school project through Toolbox Project. Open Hours of Stockholm is an open source project.

The app tells you what is open right now. We use the Google Places API to recieve results on the map. If you click any red balloon it gives you more information about the place you've clicked! It works all over the world and you can play around with it forever! Enjoy!
